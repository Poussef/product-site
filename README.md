This is my first project and it took me 3 days of working 4 hours a day so ~16 hours.
The first 2 days were a struggle bus, but, after that, it became much easier to figure what things were.
With this, the main thing I noticed was difficult was identifying what the elements were and how to
translate them onto a page from scratch.

Googling is not foreign to me, so looking up things I had forgetten or needed to learn how to do weren't hard,
but knowing what needed to be there was the main thing I started to realize.
